# DSCI 525 Team 11 Project

This project is part of the UBC MDS-Vancouver 2020-2021 DSCI-525 Web and Cloud Computing course curriculum.

## Overview

In this project, we will sequentially take on the roles of 1. Data Engineer, 2. Infrastructure, 3. Data Scientist, and 4. DevOps to perform prediction tasks on the large `daily rainfall in Australia` [dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681) (12GB) and to achieve the following 4 objectives:

1. Get the data from the web using API, process it, and convert it to an efficient file format;
2. Move the data to cloud, setup infrastructure in cloud and perform a Machine Learning model;
3. Setup distributed infrastructure (Spark) in cloud and run the same Machine Learning model;
4. Deploy the Machine Learning model in cloud so that other consumers can use it.

The purpose is to get exposure on working with a large dataset and to build and deploy ensemble machine learning models in the cloud.
